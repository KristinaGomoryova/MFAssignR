This version of the MFAssignR code is consistent with the publication in Environmental Research:
Schum S.K., L. E. Brown, L. R. Mazzoleni, MFAssignR: Molecular Formula Assignment Software for 
Ultrahigh Resolution Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Environmental Complex Mixtures, in press, 
Environmental Research, 2020.

This version also does not work in R versions 4.0.0 or greater due to changes in the underlying 
base R functions.

Nothing is here yet, but will be in the next couple days.
