# Separation of isotope mass for the resolution enhanced KMD
## for 34S = 12 (obtained by trial and error)
## for 13C = 21 (obtained from Zhang et al (2018))

## KMDr difference S = -0.291 (32S) or 0.709 (34S)
## KMDr difference C = -0.496 (12C) or 0.503 (13C)
## difference is calculated by subtracting the KMDr value for the suspected polyisotopic mass from the monoisotopic mass

# allowance for the masurment error
## for the 13C: -0.4975 < KMDrDiff < - 0.494501, and 0.501501 < KMDrDiff < 0.5045
## for the 34S: -0.29349 < KMDrDiff < -0.29051, and 0.7075 < KMDrDiff < 0.70949
